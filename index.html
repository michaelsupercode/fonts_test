                    I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too
                    old for
                    this sort of thing. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. I can't
                    get
                    involved! I've got work to do!

                    You don't believe in the Force, do you? Dantooine. They're
                    on Dantooine.
                    Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it
                    for you,
                    Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.

                    Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? He is
                    here. I
                    suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your
                    conscious self
                    and act on instinct. What?!

                    Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Don't act so
                    surprised,
                    Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time.
